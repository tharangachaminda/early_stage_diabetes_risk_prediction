# Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction (Classification Project)

Diabetes is a chronic health condition characterized by high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Glucose is a vital source of energy for the body, and its levels are primarily regulated by insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. When the body fails to produce enough insulin or becomes resistant to its effects, it leads to an accumulation of glucose in the bloodstream, resulting in diabetes.

Identifying diabetes at early stage is very helpful for the prevention or treatments. Therefore, this analysis and machine leaning model will help the community to predict whether they have a chance for having diabetes in the future or not.

In this project I will be analyzing the dataset and derive some valuable insights. Then a classification model will be developed for early stage diabetes prediction.

### Data Sources
I have used [Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishandutta/early-stage-diabetes-risk-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle.

### Technologies and Tools
1. **Decision Tree Classifier** algorithm for this project.
2. LabelEncoder and OnehotEncorder
3. Pipeline
4. GridSearchCV for parameter tuning
5. Matplotlib and Seaborn as the graphing libraries
